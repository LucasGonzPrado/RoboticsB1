<h1> INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS </h1>

This project addresses the limitations of manual assembly processes and the physical workload placed on operators by developing a robotic arm capable of handling components using a vacuum nozzle and fastening them with an integrated screwdriver tool. The proposed solution automates repetitive pick-and-place and screw-driving tasks to improve productivity, consistency, and safety in manufacturing environments.

The main goal is to ensure reliable manipulation and fastening of parts of varying geometry and size. The robotic arm combines two tools — a vacuum nozzle for gripping components and a screwdriver head for secure fastening — both mounted on the same end-effector. This integrated configuration minimizes tool-change time, reduces cycle duration, and significantly increases the efficiency of the assembly workflow.

Unlike traditional systems that rely on separate stations for gripping and screw-driving, this design enables continuous operation using a single multi-purpose end-effector. The robot can pick the part, position it precisely, and perform the fastening operation without requiring external fixtures or additional devices, making the system more compact and adaptable.

MATLAB is used for kinematic analysis, motion planning, and performance evaluation of the robotic arm to validate the coordination between the gripping and fastening actions. This modeling approach ensures the system operates within safe torque, position, and timing parameters before deployment.

Expected outcomes include reduced assembly time, enhanced accuracy, and improved ergonomics by removing repetitive manual labor from operators. By integrating a dual-function robotic end-effector for manipulation and screw-driving tasks, this project offers a flexible and scalable solution for modern automated manufacturing.
