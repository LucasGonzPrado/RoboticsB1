<h1> INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS </h1>

This project involves the design and development of a six-axis articulated robot created by the team as a versatile robotic platform for motion and manipulation tasks. The six-axis configuration allows the robot to move and orient its end-effector freely within a three-dimensional workspace, enabling smooth and coordinated movements similar to those of industrial robotic arms.

The robot was designed with the goal of achieving flexibility, stability, and ease of control. Having six degrees of freedom allows the system to reach a wide range of positions and orientations without requiring complex mechanical adjustments or repositioning of the base. This makes the robot suitable for exploring different types of motion and task execution.

MATLAB was used throughout the project to model and simulate the robot’s movement. By visualizing joint motion and end-effector trajectories, the team was able to better understand how the robot behaves and ensure that movements were consistent and repeatable. These simulations also provided a safe environment to test motion sequences before considering physical implementation.

Overall, this six-axis robot serves as a learning and development platform that supports further exploration in robotics. The project establishes a foundation for future improvements such as advanced control methods, tool integration, and more complex robotic applications.

<h2> INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS TUTORIAL </h2>
In this project, a series of three practical tasks were carried out in the Epson Lab, each designed to explore different aspects of robotic manipulation. All tasks utilize an I/O Box for robot control, and Task 3 incorporates custom-designed tools fabricated with a 3D printer.

Task 1: Pick and Place
The objective of this task is to demonstrate the robot's ability to handle multiple objects with precision and efficiency. The robot is required to pick three tokens and three blocks from a feeder and place them into designated positions on a tray. The process involves several steps:

Picking: The robot retrieves tokens and blocks from the feeder within its workspace, using its vacuum nozzle to securely lift each object.

Alignment: After each pick, the robot moves the object to an alignment plate, ensuring that it is correctly positioned and oriented for precise placement.

Placement: Once properly aligned, the robot deposits the token or block into its assigned location on the tray.

This task emphasizes accuracy, careful object handling, and the ability to manage multiple object types in a systematic sequence.

Task 2: Stacking
In this task, the robot demonstrates its capability to construct stable stacks by alternating between tokens and blocks on a platform within its workspace. The task involves:

Collecting: Using the vacuum nozzle, the robot picks up tokens and blocks from the feeder, preparing them for stacking.

Stacking: The robot alternates between tokens and blocks (e.g., token-block-token-block) to create a stable and organized stack on the designated platform.

This task highlights the robot’s ability to maintain balance, precision, and spatial awareness while performing sequential stacking operations, which is critical in automated assembly or material handling applications.
