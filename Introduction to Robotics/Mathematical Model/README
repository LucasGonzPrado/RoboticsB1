### Mathematical Model for 6-DOF Robotic Arm Kinematics and Simulation

This section presents the mathematical modeling, simulation, and analysis of a **6-DOF articulated robotic arm**, developed using the **Modified Denavit–Hartenberg (MDH)** convention and validated through MATLAB-based simulations. The model incorporates geometric offsets derived from the CAD design to better represent the physical robot.

## Key Functions

1. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - Computes the full pose (position and orientation) of the end-effector based on the six joint variables.
   - Uses an MDH-based formulation aligned with the robot’s real geometry.
   - Enables verification of robot configurations for given joint positions.

2. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Determines valid joint configurations that achieve a desired end-effector pose.
   - Allows task-level planning where the target position is known while joint angles are unknown.
   - Ensures consistency with joint limits and reachable configurations.

3. **Trajectory Planning**:
   - Generates smooth joint-space trajectories between initial and target configurations.
   - Uses time-parameterized motion to ensure continuous and physically feasible movements.
   - Visualizes both joint evolution and Cartesian end-effector motion.

4. **Jacobian Matrix and Singularity Analysis**:
   - Computes the Jacobian matrix to relate joint velocities to end-effector linear and angular velocities.
   - Evaluates singular configurations using a scalar index (σ).
   - Identifies regions of poor kinematic performance within the workspace.
