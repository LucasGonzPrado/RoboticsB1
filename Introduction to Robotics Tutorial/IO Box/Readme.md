## 🎮 Button-Based Control System — Checkers Game Robot

The robot control system uses a set of physical buttons to interact with and control the robot during the execution of a checkers game. These buttons allow the operator to select pieces, choose movement directions, and control the game flow in a simple and intuitive way. Each button is assigned a specific function to ensure smooth gameplay and accurate robot motion.

### 🔘 Button Functions
