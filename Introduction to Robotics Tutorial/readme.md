## Objective ⚙️🛠️  

### Retrieving Tokens and Blocks from the Feeder
1. **Approach the feeder:** The robot moves to the pickup zone using predefined reference points for consistent accuracy.  
2. **Acquire the object:** Once positioned above the target, the vacuum nozzle activates to secure the block or token.

### Transfer to Fixture for Centering
1. **Navigate to the fixture:** The robot transports the item to the fixture plate while avoiding collisions through pre-taught paths.  
2. **Release:** The vacuum turns off to drop the piece.  
3. **Align:** The robot adjusts the part within the fixture to ensure proper centering.  
4. **Reacquire:** With the item centered, the nozzle grabs it again for the next step.

### Placement into Tray Slots
1. **Move to the tray:** The robot moves the calibrated piece to the tray position using predefined points.  
2. **Insertion:** The robot locates the correct hole and inserts the part gently to avoid impacts.  
3. **Finalize:** The nozzle releases the piece and the sequence repeats for all remaining components.

## Components 🕹️🔧
- 1 Feeder  
- 1 Fixture  
- 1 Tray  
- 3 Tokens  
- 3 Blocks

## Objective ⚙️🛠️  

### Retrieving Tokens and Blocks from the Feeder  
1. **Approach the feeder:** The robot moves toward the pickup area using predefined coordinates to guarantee repeatable positioning.  
2. **Grasp the item:** With the robot aligned above the token or block, the nozzle engages to secure the piece.

### Creating the Stacked Column  
1. **Navigate to the base:** The robot transports the item to the stacking base through a pre-established reference point.  
2. **Alternate stacking:** Blocks and tokens are placed one after another, forming a tower with alternating elements.

## Components 🕹️🔧  
- 1 Feeder  
- 1 Base  
- 10 Tokens  
- 10 Blocks
